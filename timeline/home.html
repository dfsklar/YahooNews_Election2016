				<h2>McCain not a war hero</h2>
            <em>July 18th, 2015</em>
<p>            The New York real-estate developer and reality-show star announced his candidacy for president in June 2015 and within a month had blown up his campaign with a jaw-dropping attack on a Republican icon, Arizona Sen. John McCain.
</p><p>
“He is not a war hero,” Trump told pollster Frank Luntz, who was hosting an interview session at the Family Leadership Summit in Ames, Iowa. McCain had been at odds with Trump over his proposal for a harsh crackdown on immigration from Mexico.
            </p>
            <iframe src="http://news.yahoo.com/video/biden-not-run-170610887.html?format=embed&player_autoplay=false" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" allowtransparency="true" data-yom-embed-source="{media_id_1:b72958b0-3560-32a4-91ae-70cd82d2b734}" frameborder="0" ></iframe>
            <p>
“He is a war hero,” Luntz interjected.
<br /><br />
“He is a war hero because he was captured,” Trump said, cutting him off. “I like people that weren’t captured, OK?”
</p><p>
These remarks — from someone who had escaped the draft (because of “bone spurs” in his heels) at the height of the Vietnam War, directed at a former Navy flier and POW who had refused early repatriation without his fellow prisoners — were denounced across the political spectrum, and resulted in widespread predictions of his imminent political demise. Politico’s judgment — “Donald Trump may have finally crossed the line” — was one of the milder reactions.
</p><p>
Foreshadowing his defense in future contretemps, Trump denied the plain meaning of his remarks (“Four times I said he was a hero”) but refused to back down or apologize. If you don’t remember him dropping out in disgrace, it’s because he didn’t; in what was widely seen as a minor miracle, less than two weeks after he made the comments, polls showed him leading the Republican field by a wide margin. It was a miracle that was to occur many times during the next year, as Trump managed to turn outrage over statements that were, by most standards, outrageous into a principled refusal to bow to political correctness.
<p>
The episode also inaugurated Trump’s complicated relationship with the military. During his campaign he went out of his way to praise veterans, to denounce their treatment by the Obama administration, and to boast about his generosity toward them — a boast that turned into an embarrassment in May when the Washington Post reported that he had yet to make good on a pledge to donate $1 million to veterans charities. (Shortly afterward, Trump sent the entire amount to the Marine Corps-Law Enforcement Foundation, which supports the families of Marines and police killed in the line of duty.) Then after the Democratic convention, he picked a fight with Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the Pakistani-American parents of an Army captain killed in action in Iraq. That earned him a ringing denunciation from the Veterans of Foreign Wars. He mocked the nation’s top military leaders as weak and stupid, claimed to “know more about ISIS than the generals do,” and implied he would clean house at the Pentagon if he became president.
</p><p>
Set those gaffes against Trump’s swaggering, bellicose demeanor and popularity in the Southern and border states that disproportionately populate the military, and his ringing but vague promises to reverse what he describes as the precipitous decline in American military power under Obama. Which do you think won out? 
</p><p>
As of early October, the verdict was in: Trump was leading Clinton among veterans by 14 points.
